You can try this game at home by hiding in a large container such as a trash can or laundry basket.</p>
<p>If you are playing with friends, one person hides while the other players count to thirty. Once the hider is concealed, the other players begin searching for them. If someone finds the hider, they must replace them in the container and counting resumes from where it left off. The game is over when someone reaches thirty without finding the hider.</p>
<p>If you are playing alone, count to twenty then start looking for a place to hide. The game is over when you are found or reach twenty without finding any good hiding spots.</p>
<p>No matter how you play, remember that stealth and cunning are key to victory!</p>

If you can, then you are as smart as intelligence agencies around the world. </p>
<p>Legend has it that Ali Baba, a poor woodcutter, discovered a secret cave in the mountains with 40 robbers inside. The robbers had been using the entrance to the cave to store their loot. When Ali Baba discovered the cave, he learned their secret password, “Open Sesame!”, which allowed him to enter and take whatever he wanted. </p>
<p>The question is: can you outsmart Ali Baba and figure out the correct sequence to open his door? </p>
<p>There are many ways to try and unlock Ali Baba’s cave, but not all of them will work. In order to crack the code, you need to know some basic information about how the sequence works. </p>
<p>First of all, you need to know that there are three parts to the sequence: an opener, a mover, and a closer. The opener is just what it sounds like – it opens up the door so you can get in. The mover is responsible for moving the door along its track, and the closer is what closes it back up again. </p>
<p>The tricky part is that each part of the sequence depends on the previous one. So if you get the opener wrong, then you won’t be able to move on to the next part of the sequence. </p>
<p>Here’s an example: if your opener is “1” and your closer is “5”, then your full sequence would be “1-2-3-4-5”. Try inputting different sequences into our online tool to see if they work!</p>

<h1 id="Ali-Baba-The-Master-of-Fortune"><a href="#Ali-Baba-The-Master-of-Fortune" class="headerlink" title="Ali Baba: The Master of Fortune"></a>Ali Baba: The Master of Fortune</h1><p>“Open Sesame!” Ali Baba cried, and the door of the robbers’ den flew open.</p>
<p>Ali Baba was a poor woodcutter who lived in the countryside near Baghdad. One day, he came across a group of 40 thieves who had hidden their treasure in a secret cave. Ali Baba hid behind a large rock, and when the thieves left, he stole into the cave and took as much of the treasure as he could carry.</p>
<p>When Ali Baba got home, he told his wife about the hidden treasure. She was very excited and told her husband to keep it a secret from everyone else. The next day, when Ali Baba was cutting wood in the forest, he saw the same group of thieves coming his way. He quickly ran home and warned his wife not to let them in. His wife quickly put an empty pot on the fire and hid her husband in the oven. When the thieves asked her where Ali Baba was, she told them that he had gone to Baghdad on business. The robbers went away empty-handed.</p>
<p>The next time Ali Baba met the thieves, he showed them great respect and called them “my lords”. He even let them inside his house so that they could have some food and drink. When they were resting inside, Ali Baba shouted “Open Sesame!” The door opened and Ali Baba captured the robbers one by one.</p>
<p>Ali Baba became very rich from all his stolen treasure, and he lived happily ever after with his wife and children</p>
