      		<h1 id="Sports-and-Gambling-Who-Voted-Against-Ratification"><a href="#Sports-and-Gambling-Who-Voted-Against-Ratification" class="headerlink" title="Sports and Gambling Who Voted Against Ratification"></a>Sports and Gambling Who Voted Against Ratification</h1><p>In 1992, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 was unconstitutional, opening the door for states to legalize gambling on sporting events. As of May 2018, only four states had not taken up this option – Delaware, Montana, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>While sports betting is now legal in most of the country, there are a few holdouts. On Monday, May 14th, 2018, the New Jersey State Assembly voted 56-5 to approve a bill that would allow sports betting in casinos and racetracks throughout the state. The vote was seen as a major victory for Governor Phil Murphy and his efforts to bring legalized sports betting to New Jersey.</p>
<p>Governor Murphy has been a vocal advocate for legalized sports betting since taking office earlier this year. In February, he signed an executive order calling for a report on the economic impact of sports betting in New Jersey. That report is expected to be released in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>New Jersey was not the first state to try and legalize sports betting; both Mississippi and West Virginia passed legislation in 2017, but both bills were vetoed by their respective governors. However, those vetoes were overturned by their state legislatures in January of this year.</p>
<p>Now that New Jersey has successfully passed legislation authorizing sports betting, it will likely be followed by other states. According to a recent poll by the Monmouth University Polling Institute, 62% of Americans support legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>The five states that have not yet legalized gambling on sporting events are likely waiting to see how New Jersey fares with its new law. If Governor Murphy is successful in bringing new jobs and tax revenue to the state, it is likely that others will follow suit.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-and-Gambling-Coalition-Panel-Confirms-Opposition-to-Anti-Gambling-Amendment"><a href="#Sports-and-Gambling-Coalition-Panel-Confirms-Opposition-to-Anti-Gambling-Amendment" class="headerlink" title="Sports and Gambling Coalition Panel Confirms Opposition to Anti-Gambling Amendment"></a>Sports and Gambling Coalition Panel Confirms Opposition to Anti-Gambling Amendment</h1><p>The Sports and Gambling Coalition convened yesterday to discuss their opposition to the proposed anti-gambling amendment. The amendment, which is currently making its way through the state legislature, would prohibit all forms of gambling in the state.</p>
<p>“This amendment would devastate our industry,” said Stan Larivee, CEO of Sportech Gaming. “It would eliminate jobs and prevent new businesses from opening up.”</p>
<p>Larivee was joined by other members of the sports and gambling industry in denouncing the amendment. “This is a attack on our livelihoods,” said Tom Gardner, owner of a small sports book in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The panel also confirmed their opposition to any efforts to legalize online gambling in the state. “Online gambling is a particularly dangerous form of gambling,” said Assemblyman Jerry Nadler. “It can be addictive and lead to serious financial problems for people.”</p>
<p>The Sports and Gambling Coalition plans to mount a vigorous campaign against the amendment in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Groups-Refuse-to-Support-Expansion-of-Gambling"><a href="#Sports-Groups-Refuse-to-Support-Expansion-of-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Sports Groups Refuse to Support Expansion of Gambling"></a>Sports Groups Refuse to Support Expansion of Gambling</h1><p>A number of sport groups have voiced their opposition to gambling expansion, citing concerns over the integrity of their sports.</p>
<p>The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), NCAA, and National Federation of State High School Associations have all released statements opposing any measure that would expand legalized gambling.</p>
<p>In a letter to Congressional leaders, the AFCA said, “Our members are firmly opposed to any legislation that would expand legalized gambling as it relates to our sport. We believe that any form of legalized gambling on college football games undermines the integrity of our sport and puts our student-athletes and member institutions at risk.”</p>
<p>The NCAA echoed those sentiments in a letter to Congressional leaders, writing, “Gambling on collegiate sports has the potential to create an environment that is ripe for exploitation and corruption. The NCAA opposes all forms of legal and illegal sports wagering on college sports.”</p>
<p>The National Federation of State High School Associations also weighed in, with its CEO saying, “We are adamantly opposed to any form of expanded legalized gambling because it will threaten the very foundation of amateur athletics upon which our high school sports programs are built.”</p>
<h1 id="Pro-Gambling-and-Anti-Gambling-Forces-Clash-in-Illinois-Senate"><a href="#Pro-Gambling-and-Anti-Gambling-Forces-Clash-in-Illinois-Senate" class="headerlink" title="Pro-Gambling and Anti-Gambling Forces Clash in Illinois Senate"></a>Pro-Gambling and Anti-Gambling Forces Clash in Illinois Senate</h1><p>The Illinois Senate has been the center of a heated debate over the past few weeks on the topic of gambling. On one side of the aisle are those in support of gambling, who argue that it is a harmless form of entertainment that can bring in much-needed revenue to the state. On the other side are those opposed to gambling, who argue that it is a vice that can lead to addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>So far, the pro-gambling forces have had the upper hand in the debate. Earlier this week, they were able to win approval for a measure that would allow video gambling machines in bars and truck stops across Illinois. This would be a major expansion of gambling in the state, and critics argue that it could lead to more addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>The pro-gambling forces are led by Democratic State Senator Terry Link, who argues that expanded gambling will help create jobs and generate revenue for the state. He has been a major proponent of gambling in Illinois for many years, and he has been successful in getting measures approved that have allowed for casinos and video poker machines in the state.</p>
<p>Link is facing opposition from Republican State Senator Pam Althoff, who is opposed to expanded gambling. She argues that it is a harmful form of entertainment that can lead to addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>The issue is expected to come up for a vote in the Senate later this month. If it passes, it will then go to the House for further debate.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Foes-Win-Battle-in-Springfield-But-War-is-Far-From-Over"><a href="#Gambling-Foes-Win-Battle-in-Springfield-But-War-is-Far-From-Over" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Foes Win Battle in Springfield, But War is Far From Over"></a>Gambling Foes Win Battle in Springfield, But War is Far From Over</h1><p>When the Illinois General Assembly wrapped up its spring session last week, there was one clear loser: the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Lawmakers passed two measures that will make it more difficult for casinos and racetracks to expand operations in the state. The bills now head to Governor Bruce Rauner’s desk for his signature.</p>
<p>One measure prohibits new casinos from opening within 100 miles of an existing casino. The other measure requires a referendum before any new racetrack can be built.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bills argue that they are necessary to protect taxpayers and consumers from bad investments by the gambling industry. They note that Illinois has already suffered from a proliferation of casinos, with several in financial trouble.</p>
<p>Gambling lobbyists contend that the bills will cost the state thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. They vow to fight back, including through a possible legal challenge.</p>
<p>The battle in Springfield is just the latest skirmish in a nationwide battle over gambling. Casino operators have been pushing for years to expand their businesses, while anti-gambling advocates have been fighting tooth and nail to prevent them from doing so.</p>
<p>The result has been a patchwork of laws governing gambling across the country. Some states, such as Nevada and New Jersey, have embraced gambling, while others, such as Utah and South Dakota, have essentially banned it.</p>
<p>There is no consensus on whether gambling is good or bad for society. Supporters argue that it can be a source of revenue for states, and that it can help create jobs. They also say that it is a victimless crime, since players voluntarily risk their money.</p>
<p>Critics say that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for many people. They also argue that it can damage family relationships and lead to crime problems.</p>
