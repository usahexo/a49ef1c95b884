#  NHL superstar Alex Ovechkin hits jackpot at Cherokee casino

NHL superstar Alexander Ovechkin was all smiles when he hit the jackpot at the Cherokee casino recently. The Russian-born hockey player was in Las Vegas for the NHL Awards Show when he decided to visit the casino, and ended up winning nearly $200,000.

Ovechkin was playing blackjack when he hit the big win, and said he was excited to take home the cash. "I'm really happy," he said. "My friends are going to be really surprised."

This isn't the first time that Ovechkin has had some luck at a casino; in 2011, he won $1.3 million at a casino in Moscow. And while Ovechkin is known for being one of the best players in the NHL, he's also got a bit of a lucky streak when it comes to gambling.

It's no wonder that casinos love having high-profile athletes like Ovechkin as guests; his wins bring attention to their establishments, and help to attract other customers who may want to try their luck as well.

#  Flyers' Voracek, Sens' Karlsson among big winners at Cherokee casino

Some of the biggest winners at last night's Cherokee casino were Flyers' winger Jakub Voracek and Senators' defenseman Erik Karlsson. Voracek reported a $77,000 win, while Karlsson walked away with $73,000.

"It was a great night," Voracek said. "The games were going my way, and I just kept letting it ride."

Both players are no strangers to big payouts; Voracek won nearly $1 million at an Atlantic City casino in March, while Karlsson has taken home over $2 million in career winnings.

But Voracek and Karlsson's big scores last night pale in comparison to the largest payout ever recorded at the Cherokee casino: a cool $4 million won by a lucky player in February.

#  Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin scores big at Cherokee casino

Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin hit the jackpot at the Cherokee casino this weekend.

Malkin, who is originally from Russia, scored big at the casino, walking away with more than $1 million in winnings.

The 30-year-old superstar was playing blackjack and roulette in the casino's high-stakes area.

"It was a good weekend," Malkin said. "I'm happy I won."

Malkin has been one of the top players in the NHL for many years, and has won three Stanley Cups with the Penguins.

This latest win is just another example of his gaming prowess.

In 2017, Malkin won $500,000 at a casino in Monaco.

#  Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury wins big at Cherokee casino

Marc-Andre Fleury is a goaltender for the Golden Knights. He has made a name for himself as one of the best goalies in the NHL. Recently, he won big at the Cherokee casino.

Fleury was playing at the casino when he won a $36,000 jackpot playing blackjack. This is a major victory for Fleury, and it should help him continue his stellar play this season. The Golden Knights are one of the best teams in the NHL, and they have a real chance to make a run at the Stanley Cup.

Fleury has been a big part of their success this year. He is posting some of the best numbers of his career, and he seems to be getting better with each game. The Cherokee casino win should only further his momentum as he leads his team on a playoff run.

Fleury is one of the most popular players in the NHL, and this win will only add to his fame. He is already a three-time Stanley Cup champion, and he could very well add another championship this year. The Golden Knights are looking like one of the top teams in the league, and Fleury is a big reason for that.

If you want to see Fleury in action, be sure to check out a Golden Knights game this season. You won’t be disappointed!

When Justin Williams was a young boy, he loved nothing more than spending time at the casino with his father. So when the Carolina Hurricanes captain was offered the chance to become a part-owner of the Cherokee casino in North Carolina, he didn’t hesitate.

“I grew up going to casinos with my dad, so I have always been interested in them,” Williams said. “It’s a great opportunity to get involved in a business that I know and love, and I think it will be a lot of fun.”

The Cherokee casino is one of the largest in North Carolina, and it has been a big hit with locals since it opened in 2010. Williams is excited to help promote the casino and bring its benefits to even more people.

“This is a great opportunity to help grow the Cherokee casino and give back to the community,” Williams said. “I can’t wait to get started.”
