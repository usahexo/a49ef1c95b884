If you’re new to poker, or just want to brush up on your knowledge, this guide to poker hands in order is perfect for you.

We’ll start with the basics and work our way up to the more complex hands.

5. Straight
6. Flush
7. Full House

#  Poker Hands: The Royal Flush

The royal flush is the best and rarest hand in poker. It consists of a straight flush from ten to the ace, all of the same suit. This hand beats any other hand in poker.

The odds of being dealt a royal flush are about 1 in 650,000 hands. If you are playing five-card draw, then your chances of being dealt this hand are only 1 in 22,100 hands.

There are only four ways to make a royal flush - ten, jack, queen or king of spades; ace, two, three or four of spades. Because there are 52 cards in a deck and only 4 suits, the odds of getting any particular royal flush are 1 in 13,107.

There have been some big payouts for Royal Flushes over the years. In 2003, a Royal Flush at a $1 machine at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas paid out $82,000. In 2004, a Royal Flush at a $5 machine at the MGM Grand casino paid out $177,600!

#  Poker Hand Rankings: What Beats What? 

There are many variants of poker, and with each variant comes a different set of hand rankings. Here we will explore the most common hand rankings, and what beats what. 

The rank of hands is usually determined by the value of the cards within the hand. The higher the card, the higher the rank of the hand. The ace is high, and the two is low. The below list is in order from highest to lowest rank:

Straight flush: A straight flush is a five-card sequence all in the same suit. For example, 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ 8♥ 9♥ would be a straight flush. This is statistically the best possible hand in poker.

Four of a kind: A four of a kind is any four cards of the same rank. For example, 4♦ 4♥ 4♠ 4♣ would be a four of a kind.

Full house: A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. For example, 3♦ 3♥ 3♣ 6♣ 6♦ would be a full house.

Flush: A flush is five cards all in the same suit, not consecutive. For example, 7♦ 2♦ K♦ J♠ 10♠ would be a flush.

Straight: A straight is five consecutive cards not all in the same suit. For example, Q♦ K♦ J♣ 10♣ 9♦ would be a straight.

Three of a kind: A three of a kind is any three cards of the same rank. For example, 3♥ 3♦ 3♠ 8♠ would be three of a kind. 
Two pair: A two pair hand has two different pairs of cards. For example, 4♥ 4♦ Q♣ Q♦ would be two pair. 
One pair: One pair simply has two cards of matching rank. As an example, 5♥ 5♣ would be one pair (of fives).  Ace high/low: When there are no other high cards in play (the board does not contain another Ace), then the player with the highest Ace becomes high (or “ace high”). If there are multiple players holding an Ace high, then those players compare their second-highest card to determine who wins (and that player becomes “ace high”). In event that both players have identical second-highest card as well, then both players become “ace high” 

Now that we know which hands are ranked highest, let’s take a look at which hands beat which others hands pre-flop (before any community cards are revealed). 

Pairs always beat two overcards (cards higher than any other card on board): for instance, if you have J ♥ T ♥ on table and another player has K ♠ 7 ♦ , you win since your pair beats their two overcards . 
One pair always beats no pair : If both you and your opponent have only one card on board , then whoever has higher value card among their holecards wins . If both players have identical pairs , then it goes to second-highest ranking card held ; and if these are also equal , whichever player was first Seat Chairman at showdown will win ties . 

If neither player has any Pair , but One Card higher than any on Board - for instance 10 ♦ as shown - then this outranks Two Overcards : for instance Q ♥ 9 ♦ . (This rule doesn't apply when both players share this highest ranking Card.)

#  Poker Hands in Order from Highest to Lowest

There are many types of poker hands, and the order in which they rank is essential information for any poker player. In general, the strongest hand is a royal flush, followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair and then one pair.

Considering that there are 52 cards in a deck and that some suits are stronger than others, certain hands rank higher than others. The Ace is always high and the Two is always low, so an Ace-King hand is stronger than a Two-Queen hand. Here is the complete list of poker hands in descending order:

1) Royal flush
2) Straight flush
3) Four of a kind
4) Full house
5) Flush
6) Straight
7) Three of a kind
8) Two pair
9) One pair
