Arsenal football club, also known as the Gunners, have a rich history dating back to 1886. They are one of the most successful clubs in England with 13 league titles and 10 FA Cups.

The Gunners are also no strangers to success in European competitions, winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994 and the UEFA Champions League in 1998.

Arsenal FC play their home fixtures at the 60,000 capacity Emirates Stadium, which they moved into in 2006. Matchday tickets can be expensive, so here are a few tips on how to bet small and win big on Arsenal games.

When it comes to betting on Arsenal matches, there are a few different markets that you can consider. The most popular markets are; match result (win, draw or lose), first goal scorer and correct score.

In most cases, you will get better odds on backing Arsenal to win or draw than backing them to lose. However, if you think that Arsenal are going to lose a game, then you can make some good profits by betting on them to lose by a certain number of goals.

For example, if Arsenal were playing against Manchester City and you thought that they were going to lose 3-0, then you could back them at odds of 10/1. If they lost 3-0, then you would win £100 for every £10 that you bet.

Another market that can be profitable when betting on Arsenal is the half time / full time market. For example, if you think that Arsenal will be leading at half time but will go on to lose the game, then you could back them at odds of 2/1. If this happens, then you would win £33 for every £10 that you bet.

#  Successful Blackjack Strategy: How to Win Big by Betting Small 

Most blackjack strategy guides recommend betting big in order to win big. But what if you could win just as much by betting small? In this article, we’re going to discuss a successful blackjack strategy that involves betting small and winning more often.

If you want to employ this strategy, you need to make sure that you have the discipline to stick to it. You also need to be comfortable with the idea of losing smaller amounts of money more frequently.

The basic idea behind this strategy is that you should always bet the minimum amount allowed. This may seem like a waste of money, but over time it can actually lead to bigger wins.

Here’s how it works: let’s say you’re playing at a table that has a minimum bet of $5. If the dealer has an ace up, they will likely offer you insurance. Most people recommend rejecting insurance offers, but with this strategy we’re going to suggest taking it.

Insurance pays out 2-1 if the dealer has blackjack, so if you bet $5 on insurance and they do have blackjack, you will win $10 (your original $5 bet plus the $5 insurance payout). That may not sound like a lot, but remember that you’re only risking $5 per round.

Even if the dealer doesn’t have blackjack, you can still make a profit by winning the hand. Let’s say the dealer has a 5 showing and you have a 10. If you bet $5 on your hand and get a blackjack, your net profit will be $15 (your original $5 bet plus the $10 pay out). So over time, even if you don’t get any blackjacks, you can expect to make a small profit by following this strategy.

It’s important to keep in mind that this is not a “guaranteed” way to make money at blackjack – there is still some risk involved. But if you follow these tips and are comfortable with Small Betting Strategy, then you stand to make some healthy profits over time.
