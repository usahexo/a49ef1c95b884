The resort has been a big hit with tourists, who have made up two-thirds of its customers. The casino has also been popular with New Jersey locals, who account for about one-third of its business.

Resorts boasts more than 2,000 slot machines and 130 table games. It also has a 50,000-square-foot spa, five restaurants, two nightclubs and a golf simulator.

#  Trump Taj Mahal Casino Closing In On AC Deli

The Trump Taj Mahal Casino is set to close its doors after Labor Day, according to recent reports. The closure of the casino will mean the loss of over 3,000 jobs, as well as the closure of the casino's popular AC Deli.

The decision to close the casino was announced earlier this year, but the final date had not been set until now. According to owner Carl Icahn, the casino is no longer economically viable.

"Currently we are losing over $10 million a month and expect to lose a total of nearly $200 million this year," Icahn said in a statement released in March.

The closure of the Taj Mahal will leave Atlantic City with only eight casinos remaining in operation.
