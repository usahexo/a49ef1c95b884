#  Grand Opening of Margaritaville Casino Biloxi

The much-anticipated Margaritaville Casino Biloxi had its grand opening on Thursday, December 8. The $118-million casino is the first major resort to open in Biloxi since Hurricane Katrina devastated the area in 2005.

Guests were greeted by a large, festive tent filled with margaritas and musical entertainment. Attendees sampled food from the casino’s restaurants, including Landshark Bar & Grill, Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville, Bluff View Buffet, and Olio.

The 30,000 square foot casino features 1,650 slots and video poker machines, 38 table games, and a high-limit salon. There is also a 12-story hotel with 256 rooms and suites.

Hurricane Katrina caused more than $200 billion in damage in the Gulf region and killed 1,833 people. The storm was one of the deadliest in US history. However, Biloxi has made a remarkable recovery in recent years and is now home to a number of casinos and resorts.

The Margaritaville Casino Biloxi is owned by Penn National Gaming, one of the largest gaming companies in the US. It is the company’s first casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
