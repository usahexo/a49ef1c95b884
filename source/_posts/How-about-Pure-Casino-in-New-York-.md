#  Who was Picasso? 

Pablo Picasso was a Spanish painter who is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. He was born on October 25, 1881, in Málaga, Andalusia, and died on April 8, 1973, in Mougins, France.

Picasso was a child prodigy who began painting at the age of seven. He studied at the Royal Academy of Art in Madrid before moving to Paris in 1901. There he became associated with the Parisian avant-garde movement and established himself as one of the most innovative and controversial artists of his generation.

Picasso’s work was often denounced by critics for its abstract and Cubist elements, but he continued to experiment throughout his career, developing a unique style that profoundly influenced later generations of artists. He was also a prolific artist, producing over 50,000 artworks during his lifetime.

Picasso’s legacy is enduring and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest artists of all time.

#  What is a casino? 
A casino is a facility where gamblers can play traditional games of chance, such as blackjack, poker, and roulette, and bet on sports. Casinos also offer other gambling activities, such as slot machines, video poker, and bingo. 

# History of casinos 
Gambling has been around for centuries. The first recorded mention of gambling comes from the ancient Chinese book “Luo Guanzhong’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms”, which was written in the 14th century. In the book, a game called “dominoes” is mentioned. However, it wasn’t until the 17th century that casinos as we know them began to appear. 

The first casino was the Ridotto, which was opened in Venice in 1638. The Ridotto was a public gaming house that offered a variety of games, including dice, cards, and roulette. Over the years, more and more casinos began to open up in places like Monaco and Las Vegas. 

Today, there are casinos all over the world. In fact, there are more than 100 different countries that have at least one casino operating within their borders. 

# Types of casinos 
There are several different types of casinos. The most common type is the land-based casino. These casinos are typically located in major cities or tourist destinations. They offer table games and slot machines, as well as restaurants, bars, and hotels. 

 Another type of casino is the cruise ship casino. These casinos are found on cruise ships and offer a variety of table games and slot machines. They also often have restaurants and bars onboard. 

The third type of casino is the online casino. These casinos are websites that allow players to gamble online using real money. They offer a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and bingo. 

# How casinos work 
Casinos make money by taking a percentage of each bet that is made in their facility. This percentage is known as the “house edge” or “house advantage”. The house edge varies depending on the game being played but is typically around 2-5%. This means that for every $100 that is wagered at a casino, they will keep between $2 and $5 as profit.
